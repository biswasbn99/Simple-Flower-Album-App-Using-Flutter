> “A simple, elegant, and responsive photo gallery app built with Flutter — showcasing the beauty of grid layouts and local image assets.”

---

## 🪻 **Overview**

The **Flower Photo Album App** is a lightweight Flutter project designed to display a vibrant collection of flower images in a clean, two-column grid layout.
It uses Flutter’s powerful `GridView.builder` widget for efficient scrolling, combined with modern UI touches like rounded corners and balanced spacing.

This project is an excellent example for students and beginners learning how to:

* Load and organize **local image assets**
* Use **lists and loops** in Flutter
* Build responsive grid-based layouts
* Apply clean and consistent design patterns

---

## 🌸 **Key Features**

✨ **Dynamic Grid Layout** – Displays multiple photos neatly using `GridView.builder`
🌼 **Local Asset Integration** – All images are loaded directly from the project’s assets folder
🌻 **Smooth Rounded Corners** – Every photo has soft edges for a modern visual style
🌿 **Clean AppBar Design** – Features a centered title with bold, stylish typography
🌷 **Easy to Customize** – Add or replace photos effortlessly, extend features as you grow

---

## 🧭 **Project Overview**

The app consists of two main Dart files:

* **main.dart** → Entry point of the app that runs the MaterialApp widget
* **photohome.dart** → Displays the actual photo gallery using a dynamic grid

Images are stored inside a dedicated folder named `assets/images/`, where each file (e.g., `1.jpg`, `2.jpg`, etc.) is loaded into the grid view.

---

## 🪴 **How the App Works**

1. The app launches with a **beautifully styled AppBar** titled *“Flowers Album App”*.
2. A **GridView** appears below, showing multiple flower images in a 2-column layout.
3. Each photo is **wrapped in rounded corners**, creating a smooth and aesthetic appearance.
4. The user can scroll vertically through the grid to browse the entire collection.
5. The layout automatically adapts to various screen sizes and orientations.
